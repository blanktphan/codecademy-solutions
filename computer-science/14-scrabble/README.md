# üë®‚Äçüíª Project: Scrabble

## üéØ The Challenge from [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/)

In this project, you will process some data from a group of friends playing scrabble. You will use dictionaries to organize players, words, and points.

There are many ways you can extend this project on your own if you finish and want to get more practice!

## üîç **Code Explanation (Generate by GitHub Copilot)**

The **Scrabble program** uses **Python dictionaries** and **functions** to create a *scoring system* that calculates **word values** and tracks **player points**. Here's how it works:

### **üìã Complete Code Structure**

```python
# Scrabble letter values setup
letters = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J", "K", "L", "M", "N", "O", "P", "Q", "R", "S", "T", "U", "V", "W", "X", "Y", "Z"]
points = [1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 8, 5, 1, 3, 4, 1, 3, 10, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 8, 4, 10]

# Create letter-to-points mapping dictionary
letter_to_points = {key:value for key,value in zip(letters, points)}

letter_to_points[' '] = 0  # Blank tiles worth 0 points

# Function to calculate word score
def score_word(word):
  point_total = 0
  for letter in word.upper():  # Convert to uppercase
      if letter_to_points.get(letter, 0):  # Safe dictionary lookup
        point_total += letter_to_points[letter]  # Add letter points
  return point_total

brownie_points = score_word('BROWNIE')  # Test word scoring

print(brownie_points)

# Player game data - nested dictionary structure
player_to_words = {
  'Player1': ['BLUE', 'TENNIS', 'EXIT'],
  'wordNerd': ['EARTH', 'EYES', 'MACHINE'],
  'Lexi Con': ['ERASER', 'BELLY', 'HUSKY'],
  'Prof Reader': ['ZAP', 'COMA', 'PERIOD']
}

# Function to add words to player
def play_word(player, word):
  player_to_words[player].append(word)  # Add word to player's list
  return player_to_words

player_to_points = {}  # Dictionary to store player scores

# Function to calculate all player totals
def update_point_totals():
  for player, words in player_to_words.items():  # Iterate through players
    player_points = 0
    for word in words:  # Calculate points for each word
      player_points += score_word(word)
    player_to_points[player] = player_points  # Store total score
  return player_to_points
```

### **üìä Expected Output**

```terminal
15  # Score for 'BROWNIE'
{'Player1': 37, 'wordNerd': 42, 'Lexi Con': 44, 'Prof Reader': 31}
```

### **üîÑ Program Flow**

1. **Setup** ‚Üí Create *letter-point* **mapping dictionary**
2. **Function Definition** ‚Üí Build *word scoring* **system**
3. **Data Organization** ‚Üí Store *player words* in **nested structure**
4. **Game Management** ‚Üí Add *new words* to **players**
5. **Score Calculation** ‚Üí Calculate *total points* for **all players**
6. **Results Display** ‚Üí Show *final scores* and **rankings**

### **üéÆ Game Applications**

This system enables:
- **Word validation** and *scoring*
- **Player management** and *progress tracking*
- **Tournament organization** with *multiple games*
- **Statistics analysis** of *word choices*

This project demonstrates how **dictionaries and functions** work together to create *game logic* and **data management systems** for word games like Scrabble.
