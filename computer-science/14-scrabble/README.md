# üìã Project: Scrabble

## üéØ The Challenge from [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/)

In this project, you'll work with data processing for a group of friends playing Scrabble. You'll learn to use Python dictionaries to organize players, words, and scoring systems effectively.

The project teaches you how to:
- Create letter-to-point mapping systems
- Build word scoring functions
- Manage player data with nested dictionaries
- Calculate total scores across multiple players

There are many ways you can extend this project if you finish and want to get more practice with dictionary manipulation and game logic!

## üîç Code Explanation (Generated by AI)

The Scrabble program uses Python dictionaries and functions to create a scoring system that calculates word values and tracks player points. Here's how it works:

### üìã Complete Code Structure

```python
# Scrabble letter values setup
letters = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J", "K", "L", "M", "N", "O", "P", "Q", "R", "S", "T", "U", "V", "W", "X", "Y", "Z"]
points = [1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 8, 5, 1, 3, 4, 1, 3, 10, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 8, 4, 10]

# Create letter-to-points mapping dictionary
letter_to_points = {key:value for key,value in zip(letters, points)}

letter_to_points[' '] = 0  # Blank tiles worth 0 points

# Function to calculate word score
def score_word(word):
  point_total = 0
  for letter in word.upper():  # Convert to uppercase
      if letter_to_points.get(letter, 0):  # Safe dictionary lookup
        point_total += letter_to_points[letter]  # Add letter points
  return point_total

brownie_points = score_word('BROWNIE')  # Test word scoring

print(brownie_points)

# Player game data - nested dictionary structure
player_to_words = {
  'Player1': ['BLUE', 'TENNIS', 'EXIT'],
  'wordNerd': ['EARTH', 'EYES', 'MACHINE'],
  'Lexi Con': ['ERASER', 'BELLY', 'HUSKY'],
  'Prof Reader': ['ZAP', 'COMA', 'PERIOD']
}

# Function to add words to player
def play_word(player, word):
  player_to_words[player].append(word)  # Add word to player's list
  return player_to_words

player_to_points = {}  # Dictionary to store player scores

# Function to calculate all player totals
def update_point_totals():
  for player, words in player_to_words.items():  # Iterate through players
    player_points = 0
    for word in words:  # Calculate points for each word
      player_points += score_word(word)
    player_to_points[player] = player_points  # Store total score
  return player_to_points
```

### üéØ How It Works

1. Dictionary Creation with List Comprehension
```python
letter_to_points = {key:value for key,value in zip(letters, points)}
```
- `zip()` function pairs letters with corresponding point values
- Dictionary comprehension creates mapping in one line
- Key-value pairs enable fast letter lookup

2. Word Scoring Function
```python
def score_word(word):
  point_total = 0
  for letter in word.upper():
      if letter_to_points.get(letter, 0):
        point_total += letter_to_points[letter]
  return point_total
```
- String method `upper()` ensures case consistency
- Dictionary `get()` method provides safe lookup with default
- Accumulator pattern sums all letter values

3. Player Data Management
```python
player_to_words = {
  'Player1': ['BLUE', 'TENNIS', 'EXIT'],
  'wordNerd': ['EARTH', 'EYES', 'MACHINE'],
  ...
}
```
- Nested data structure: dictionary contains lists
- Keys are player names, values are word lists
- Organized storage for game state tracking

4. Dynamic Word Addition
```python
def play_word(player, word):
  player_to_words[player].append(word)
  return player_to_words
```
- Function modifies existing player data
- List `append()` method adds new words to player
- Return statement provides updated game state

5. Score Calculation System
```python
def update_point_totals():
  for player, words in player_to_words.items():
    player_points = 0
    for word in words:
      player_points += score_word(word)
    player_to_points[player] = player_points
  return player_to_points
```
- Dictionary `items()` method iterates key-value pairs
- Nested loops process each player's complete word list
- Function calls calculate individual word scores

### üí° Key Programming Concepts

- `Dictionaries` - Key-value mapping for fast data lookup
- `List Comprehension` - Creating dictionaries efficiently
- `Dictionary Methods` - Using get(), items(), keys()
- `Nested Data Structures` - Dictionaries containing lists
- `Function Design` - Creating reusable game logic
- `Data Processing` - Converting raw data into usable formats
- `Game State Management` - Tracking player progress

### üéÆ Scrabble Point Values

High Value Letters (8-10 points):
- J, X = 8 points
- Q, Z = 10 points

Medium Value Letters (3-5 points):
- B, C, M, P = 3 points
- F, H, V, W, Y = 4 points
- K = 5 points

Low Value Letters (1-2 points):
- A, E, I, O, U, L, N, S, T, R = 1 point
- D, G = 2 points

### üìä Expected Output

```terminal
15  # Score for 'BROWNIE'
{'Player1': 37, 'wordNerd': 42, 'Lexi Con': 44, 'Prof Reader': 31}
```

### üîÑ Program Flow

1. Setup ‚Üí Create letter-point mapping dictionary
2. Function Definition ‚Üí Build word scoring system
3. Data Organization ‚Üí Store player words in nested structure
4. Game Management ‚Üí Add new words to players
5. Score Calculation ‚Üí Calculate total points for all players
