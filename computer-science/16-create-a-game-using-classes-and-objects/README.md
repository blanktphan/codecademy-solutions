# üìã Project: Create a Game Using Classes and Objects

## üéØ The Challenge from [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/)

Welcome! You now have all the tools needed to build a complex program using multiple interacting classes. This is where creativity takes center stage.

For this project, create a fully functional system involving multiple classes with specific requirements detailed below.

Choosing your project idea is crucial! Take time to think about what excites you - this motivation will drive you to completion.

### üí° Project Ideas

If you need inspiration, consider these examples:

- Pokemon-like Game: Create Creature classes that battle, Trainer classes with multiple creatures, and Items for creature enhancement
- Casino System: Build multiple Game classes with a Player class managing money and wagers
- Store Simulator: Design a Store with food Item inventory and Shopper classes for purchasing
- High School Simulator: Create School, Student, Teacher, and Course classes with grade tracking, subjects, and friendships

### üñ•Ô∏è Running Your Code

This project provides terminal access for interactive functions like `input()`. To run your code:

1. Save your code in `script.py`
2. In the terminal, type: `python3 script.py`
3. Press Enter to execute

Try the Demo: Test with the provided `pokemon.py` file:
```sh
python3 pokemon.py
```

This will start an interactive Pokemon game where you'll be prompted for input.

## üîç Code Explanation (Generated by AI)

The Object-Oriented Game program uses Python classes and objects to create an interactive pet simulation with multiple interacting entities. Here's how it works:

### üìã Complete Code Structure

```python
# Cat class definition with attributes and methods
class Cat():
    def __init__(self, name, old, color):
        self.name = name
        self.old = old
        self.color = color

    def info(self):
        print('This cat is name {}, color is {}. and {} year old'.format(self.name, self.color, self.old))

    def moew(self):
        print('{}: say moew!'.format(self.name))

    def birthday(self):
        now = self.old + 1
        print('Now {} has growth up from {} to {}'.format(self.name, self.old, now))
        self.old = now

    def __repr__(self):
        return 'This cat is name {}. and {} year old.'.format(self.name, self.old)

# Person class definition with cat ownership
class Person():
    def __init__(self, name, old):
        self.name = name
        self.old = old
        self.owner = []

    def info(self):
        print('This person is name {},owner cat is {} now  and {} year old.'.format(self.name, self.owner, self.old))

    def addCat(self, cat):
        if type(cat) is Cat:
            self.owner.append(cat.name)

    def birthday(self):
        now = self.old + 1
        print('Now {} has growth up from {} to {}'.format(self.name, self.old, now))
        self.old = now

    def __repr__(self):
        return 'this person is name {}. and owner cat is {}'.format(self.name, self.owner)

# Create object instances
cat1 = Cat('preem', 0, 'black')
cat2 = Cat('AA', 1, 'white')
person1 = Person('Thai', 20)
person2 = Person('Next', 20)

# Test object interactions
cat1.info()
cat1.birthday()
person1.addCat(cat1)
print(person1)
```

### üéØ How It Works

1. Class Definition
```python
class Cat():
    def __init__(self, name, old, color):
        self.name = name
        self.old = old
        self.color = color
```
- Class keyword defines blueprint for Cat objects
- Constructor method `__init__()` initializes object attributes
- Self parameter refers to current instance of object
- Instance attributes store unique data for each cat

2. Instance Methods
```python
def info(self):
    print('This cat is name {}, color is {}. and {} year old'.format(self.name, self.color, self.old))

def moew(self):
    print('{}: say moew!'.format(self.name))
```
- Instance methods define behaviors that objects can perform
- Self access allows methods to read/modify attributes
- String formatting creates dynamic output using object data

3. State Modification
```python
def birthday(self):
    now = self.old + 1
    print('Now {} has growth up from {} to {}'.format(self.name, self.old, now))
    self.old = now
```
- Methods can modify object state by changing attributes
- Age tracking simulates time progression in game world
- State persistence maintains changes between method calls

4. Object Relationships
```python
class Person():
    def __init__(self, name, old):
        self.owner = []  # List to store owned cats
    
    def addCat(self, cat):
        if type(cat) is Cat:
            self.owner.append(cat.name)
```
- Composition relationship where Person owns multiple Cats
- Type checking ensures only Cat objects can be added
- List storage maintains collection of owned pets

5. String Representation
```python
def __repr__(self):
    return 'This cat is name {}. and {} year old.'.format(self.name, self.old)
```
- Magic method `__repr__()` defines string representation
- Print functionality displays object information automatically
- Debugging aid for object inspection

### üí° Key Programming Concepts

- `Classes` - Blueprints for creating objects
- `Objects` - Instances of classes with unique data
- `Encapsulation` - Data and methods bundled together
- `Instance Attributes` - Unique data for each object
- `Instance Methods` - Functions that operate on object data
- `Constructor` - Special method for object initialization
- `Composition` - Objects containing other objects
- `Type Checking` - Validating object types

### üê± Object-Oriented Design

Cat Class Structure:
- Attributes: `name`, `old`, `color`
- Methods: `info()`, `moew()`, `birthday()`, `__repr__()`
- Behavior: Display info, make sounds, age progression

Person Class Structure:
- Attributes: `name`, `old`, `owner` (list)
- Methods: `info()`, `addCat()`, `birthday()`, `__repr__()`
- Behavior: Manage pet ownership, age progression

### üîÑ Program Flow

1. Class Definition ‚Üí Create blueprints for Cat and Person
2. Object Creation ‚Üí Instantiate specific cats and people
3. Method Calls ‚Üí Execute behaviors on objects
4. State Changes ‚Üí Modify object attributes through methods
5. Relationship Building ‚Üí Connect objects through ownership
6. Information Display ‚Üí Show object states and relationships

### üéÆ Game Applications

This OOP structure enables:
- Pet simulation with individual characteristics
- Ownership management between entities
- Time progression with aging mechanics
- Interactive behaviors for user engagement
- Expandable design for additional features

### üìä Expected Output

```terminal
This cat is name preem, color is black. and 0 year old
Now preem has growth up from 0 to 1
preem: say moew!
this person is name Thai. and owner cat is ['preem']
```

This project demonstrates how Object-Oriented Programming creates modular, reusable code for game development and interactive simulations.
