# üìã Project: Trends in Startups

## üéØ The Challenge from [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/)

Welcome to your first day as a [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/) reporter! Your mission is to analyze rising trends in the startup ecosystem and write a compelling article.

Your Assignment:
- Analyze a `project.sqlite` database containing a `startups` table
- Extract insights from a portfolio of industry-leading companies
- Use SQL aggregate functions to uncover interesting patterns and trends

Objective:
Write data-driven queries to reveal compelling insights about these startups that will form the foundation of your article.

Ready to dive into the data? Let's explore what the numbers reveal about the startup world!

## üîç Code Explanation (Generated by AI)

The Trends in Startups program uses SQL aggregate functions and grouping operations to analyze startup data and extract meaningful business insights. Here's how it works:

### üìã Complete Code Structure

```sql
-- Display all startup data
SELECT *
FROM startups;

-- Count total number of startups
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM startups;

-- Calculate total valuation of all startups
SELECT SUM(valuation)
FROM startups;

-- Find highest funding raised in Seed stage
SELECT MAX(raised)
FROM startups
WHERE stage = 'Seed';

-- Find earliest founding year
SELECT MIN(founded)
FROM startups;

-- Calculate average valuation across all startups
SELECT AVG(valuation)
FROM startups;

-- Average valuation by category (grouped)
SELECT category, AVG(valuation)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category;

-- Average valuation by category (rounded to 2 decimals)
SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(valuation), 2)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category;

-- Count startups in each category
SELECT category, COUNT(*)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category;

-- Categories with more than 3 startups
SELECT category, COUNT(*)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;

-- Average employees by location
SELECT location, AVG(employees)
FROM startups
GROUP BY location;

-- Locations with average >500 employees
SELECT location, AVG(employees)
FROM startups
GROUP BY location
HAVING AVG(employees) > 500;
```

### üéØ How It Works

1. Basic Data Overview
```sql
SELECT * FROM startups;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM startups;
```
- SELECT statement retrieves all startup records
- COUNT function calculates total number of entries
- Data exploration provides complete dataset overview

2. Aggregate Calculations
```sql
SELECT SUM(valuation) FROM startups;
SELECT AVG(valuation) FROM startups;
```
- SUM function calculates total market valuation
- AVG function computes average company value
- Mathematical operations provide industry metrics

3. Maximum and Minimum Analysis
```sql
SELECT MAX(raised) FROM startups WHERE stage = 'Seed';
SELECT MIN(founded) FROM startups;
```
- MAX function finds highest funding amounts
- MIN function identifies earliest founding dates
- Conditional filtering targets specific subsets

4. Grouping and Categorization
```sql
SELECT category, AVG(valuation)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category;
```
- GROUP BY clause organizes data by categories
- Aggregate functions calculate metrics per group
- Category analysis reveals industry patterns

5. Data Precision
```sql
SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(valuation), 2)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category;
```
- ROUND function formats decimal places for readability
- Precision control improves data presentation
- Formatted output enhances report quality

6. Counting and Distribution
```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(*)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category;
```
- COUNT with GROUP BY shows distribution across categories
- Market segmentation analysis reveals industry focus
- Portfolio composition insights for investment patterns

7. Conditional Grouping
```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(*)
FROM startups
GROUP BY category
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;
```
- HAVING clause filters grouped results by conditions
- Post-aggregation filtering for significant categories
- Threshold analysis identifies major sectors

8. Multi-dimensional Analysis
```sql
SELECT location, AVG(employees)
FROM startups
GROUP BY location
HAVING AVG(employees) > 500;
```
- Location-based grouping for geographic insights
- Employee metrics reveal company scale
- Regional analysis shows startup hubs

### üí° Key SQL Concepts

- `Aggregate Functions` - COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN
- `GROUP BY Clause` - Organizing data by categories
- `HAVING Clause` - Filtering grouped results
- `ROUND Function` - Formatting numerical precision
- `Conditional Aggregation` - WHERE with aggregate functions
- `Multi-level Grouping` - Complex data organization
- `Statistical Analysis` - Mathematical operations on datasets

### üìä Startup Analysis Workflow

1. Data Overview
- Total startups in portfolio
- Complete dataset examination
- Data quality assessment

2. Financial Metrics
- Total market valuation
- Average company values
- Funding analysis by stage

3. Temporal Analysis
- Founding year trends
- Historical patterns
- Market evolution tracking

4. Categorical Insights
- Industry distribution by category
- Average valuations per sector
- Market concentration analysis

5. Geographic Analysis
- Location-based metrics
- Regional startup hubs
- Geographic distribution patterns

### üöÄ Expected Analysis Results

| Analysis Type | Purpose | Business Insight |
|---------------|---------|------------------|
| COUNT(*) | Portfolio size | Total startup coverage |
| SUM(valuation) | Market cap | Total portfolio value |
| AVG by category | Sector analysis | Industry valuations |
| MAX(raised) | Top funding | Investment peaks |
| GROUP BY location | Geographic | Regional trends |

### üìà Startup Intelligence Applications

This SQL analysis enables:
- Investment portfolio analysis and tracking
- Market trend identification across sectors
- Geographic distribution insights for expansion
- Funding pattern analysis by stage
- Industry benchmarking and competitive intelligence

This project demonstrates how SQL aggregate functions can extract actionable business insights from startup databases for investment analysis and market research.
