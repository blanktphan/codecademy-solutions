# 📋 Project: Gradebook

## 🎯 The Challenge from [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/)

You are a student looking to organize your academic subjects and grades using Python programming. This project will help you explore and apply fundamental list operations to create a comprehensive gradebook system for tracking your academic performance across multiple semesters.

🎯 Project Objectives:
- Create and manage lists to store subject names and corresponding grades
- Implement list methods for adding, modifying, and removing academic data
- Combine multiple semester records into a unified gradebook
- Practice nested list structures for organized data management
- Apply different grading systems (numerical and Pass/Fail) within the same dataset

## 🔍 Code Explanation (Generated by AI)

The Gradebook program uses Python lists and list methods to organize and manipulate student grades and subjects. Here's how it works:

### 📋 Complete Code Structure

```python
# Previous semester data
last_semester_gradebook = [["politics", 80], ["latin", 96], ["dance", 97], ["architecture", 65]]

# Your code below: 
subjects = ['physics', 'calculus', 'poetry', 'history']  # List of subjects

grades = [98, 97, 85, 88]  # Corresponding grades

# Create gradebook combining subjects and grades
gradebook = [['physics', 98], ['calculus', 97], ['poetry', 85], ['history'], 88]

# Add new subjects to gradebook
gradebook.append(["computer science", 100])

gradebook.append(["visual arts", 93])

# Increase visual arts grade by 5 points (93 + 5 = 98)
gradebook[gradebook.index(['visual arts', 93])][1] += 5

# Remove numerical grade from poetry
gradebook[2].remove(85)

# Change poetry to Pass/Fail system
gradebook[2].append("Pass")

# Combine this semester with last semester
full_gradebook = last_semester_gradebook + gradebook

print(full_gradebook)  # Display complete gradebook
```

### 🎯 How It Works

1. Data Structure Setup
```python
last_semester_gradebook = [["politics", 80], ["latin", 96], ["dance", 97], ["architecture", 65]]
```
- Nested lists store subject-grade pairs from previous semester
- Each inner list contains [subject, grade] format

2. Current Semester Data
```python
subjects = ['physics', 'calculus', 'poetry', 'history']  # Separate lists
grades = [98, 97, 85, 88]  # Corresponding grades
```
- Parallel lists store subjects and grades separately
- Index correspondence - same position = same student

3. Gradebook Creation
```python
gradebook = [['physics', 98], ['calculus', 97], ['poetry', 85], ['history'], 88]
```
- Manual construction of nested list structure
- Note: Contains an error - `['history'], 88` should be `['history', 88]`

4. Adding New Subjects
```python
gradebook.append(["computer science", 100])
gradebook.append(["visual arts", 93])
```
- `append()` method adds new subject-grade pairs to end of list
- Dynamic expansion of the gradebook

5. Grade Modification
```python
gradebook[gradebook.index(['visual arts', 93])][1] += 5
```
- `index()` method finds position of the subject-grade pair
- Nested indexing `[1]` accesses the grade (second element)
- Compound assignment `+=` increases grade by 5 points

6. Grading System Change
```python
gradebook[2].remove(85)  # Remove numerical grade
gradebook[2].append("Pass")  # Add Pass/Fail grade
```
- `remove()` method deletes specific value from list
- `append()` method adds new grading system to subject

7. Semester Combination
```python
full_gradebook = last_semester_gradebook + gradebook
```
- List concatenation combines two semesters using `+` operator
- Creates new list with all historical data

### 💡 Key Programming Concepts

- `Lists` - Storing multiple related items in ordered collections
- `Nested Lists` - Lists within lists for structured data
- `List Methods` - Using append(), remove(), index() for manipulation
- `List Indexing` - Accessing specific elements using position numbers
- `List Concatenation` - Combining multiple lists with `+` operator
- `Parallel Lists` - Related data stored in separate lists
- `Dynamic Data Modification` - Adding, removing, and changing list contents

### 📚 List Operations Breakdown

Adding Elements:
- `append()` - Adds new item to end of list
- `+` operator - Combines two lists together

Finding Elements:
- `index()` - Returns position of specific item
- `[position]` - Accesses element at given index

Modifying Elements:
- `remove()` - Deletes specific value from list
- `[index] = value` - Changes element at position

### 🎓 Expected Output

```python
[['politics', 80], ['latin', 96], ['dance', 97], ['architecture', 65], 
 ['physics', 98], ['calculus', 97], ['poetry', 'Pass'], ['history'], 88, 
 ['computer science', 100], ['visual arts', 98]]
```

### 🔄 Program Flow

1. Historical Data → Load previous semester grades
2. Current Setup → Create this semester's gradebook
3. Data Entry → Add new subjects and grades
4. Grade Updates → Modify existing grades as needed
5. System Changes → Convert numerical to Pass/Fail
6. Data Consolidation → Combine all semesters into complete record

This program demonstrates how lists and list methods can manage educational data and create flexible grading systems.
