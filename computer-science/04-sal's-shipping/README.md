# üë®‚Äçüíª Project: Sal's Shipping

## üéØ The Challenge form [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/)

Sal runs the biggest shipping company in the tri-county area, Sal‚Äôs Shippers. Sal wants to make sure that every single one of his customers has the best, and most affordable experience shipping their packages.

In this project, you‚Äôll build a program that will take the weight of a package and determine the cheapest way to ship that package using Sal‚Äôs Shippers.

Sal‚Äôs Shippers has several different options for a customer to ship their package:

- Ground Shipping, which is a small flat charge plus a rate based on the weight of your package.
- Ground Shipping Premium, which is a much higher flat charge, but you aren‚Äôt charged for weight.
- Drone Shipping (new), which has no flat charge, but the rate based on weight is triple the rate of ground shipping.
Here are the prices:

### Ground Shipping

|Weight of Package | Price per Pound | Flat Charge |
| :--------------- | :-------------- | :---------- |
| 2 lb or less | $1.50 | $20.00 |
| Over 2 lb but less than or equal to 6 lb | $3.00 | $20.00 |
| Over 6 lb but less than or equal to 10 lb | $4.00 | $20.00 |
| Over 10 lb | $4.75 | $20.00 |

### Ground Shipping Premium

Flat charge: $125.00

#### Drone Shipping

|Weight of Package | Price per Pound | Flat Charge |
| :--------------- | :-------------- | :---------- |
| 2 lb or less | $4.50 | $0.00 |
| Over 2 lb but less than or equal to 6 lb | $9.00 | $0.00 |
| Over 6 lb but less than or equal to 10 lb | $12.00 | $0.00 |
| Over 10 lb | $14.75 | $0.00 |

Write a shipping.py Python program that asks the user for the weight of their package and then tells them which method of shipping is cheapest and how much it will cost to ship their package using Sal‚Äôs Shippers.

## üîç **Code Explanation (Generate by GitHub Copilot)**

The **Sal's Shipping program** uses **control flow** and **conditional logic** to determine the *cheapest shipping method* based on **package weight**. Here's how it works:

### **üìã Complete Code Structure**

```python
weight = 41.5  # Package weight in pounds

# Ground Shipping - Calculate cost based on weight tiers
if weight <= 2:
  cost_ground = (weight * 1.5) + 20  # $1.50/lb + $20 flat rate
elif weight > 2 and weight <= 6:
  cost_ground = (weight * 3) + 20    # $3.00/lb + $20 flat rate
elif weight > 6 and weight <= 10:
  cost_ground = (weight * 4) + 20    # $4.00/lb + $20 flat rate
elif weight > 10:
  cost_ground = (weight * 4.75) + 20 # $4.75/lb + $20 flat rate

print('Ground Shipping $', cost_ground)

# Ground Shipping Premium - Fixed flat rate
cost_premium = 125  # Always $125 regardless of weight

print('Ground Shipping Premium $', cost_premium)

# Drone Shipping - Calculate cost based on weight tiers (no flat rate)
if weight <= 2:
  cost_drone = (weight * 4.5)   # $4.50/lb only
elif weight > 2 and weight <= 6:
  cost_drone = (weight * 9)     # $9.00/lb only
elif weight > 6 and weight <= 10:
  cost_drone = (weight * 12)    # $12.00/lb only
elif weight > 10:
  cost_drone = (weight * 14.25) # $14.25/lb only

print('Drone Shipping $', cost_drone)

# Compare all three options and find cheapest
if cost_ground < cost_drone and cost_ground < cost_premium:
    print(f"Ground Shipping is cheapest at ${cost_ground}")
elif cost_drone < cost_premium:
    print(f"Drone Shipping is cheapest at ${cost_drone}")
else:
    print(f"Premium Ground Shipping is cheapest at ${cost_premium}")
```

### **üéØ How It Works**

**1. Weight Input**
```python
weight = 41.5  # Package weight in pounds
```
- Stores the **package weight** for *cost calculations*
- Can be modified to accept **user input** later

**2. Ground Shipping Calculation**
```python
if weight <= 2:
  cost_ground = (weight * 1.5) + 20  # Tier 1: $1.50/lb + $20
elif weight > 2 and weight <= 6:
  cost_ground = (weight * 3) + 20    # Tier 2: $3.00/lb + $20
```
- **If/elif chain** handles *different weight ranges*
- **Formula:** `(weight √ó rate) + flat_charge`
- **All tiers** include a *$20 flat rate*

**3. Premium Ground Shipping**
```python
cost_premium = 125  # Fixed $125 regardless of weight
```
- **Simple assignment** - no *calculation needed*
- **Flat rate** pricing for *convenience*

**4. Drone Shipping Calculation**
```python
if weight <= 2:
  cost_drone = (weight * 4.5)   # $4.50/lb only
elif weight > 2 and weight <= 6:
  cost_drone = (weight * 9)     # $9.00/lb only
```
- **Similar structure** to ground shipping
- **Higher rates** but *no flat charge*
- **Weight-only** pricing model

**5. Cost Comparison Logic**
```python
if cost_ground < cost_drone and cost_ground < cost_premium:
    print(f"Ground Shipping is cheapest")
elif cost_drone < cost_premium:
    print(f"Drone Shipping is cheapest")
else:
    print(f"Premium Ground Shipping is cheapest")
```
- **Multiple comparisons** find the *lowest cost*
- **Logical operators** (`<` and `and`) evaluate **conditions**
- **F-string formatting** displays *results clearly*

### **üí° Key Programming Concepts**

- **`Control Flow`** - Using *if/elif/else* for **decision making**
- **`Conditional Logic`** - Multiple *comparisons* and **logical operators**
- **`Mathematical Operations`** - Calculating *costs* using **arithmetic**
- **`Comparison Operators`** - Using `<`, `<=`, `>` for **evaluations**
- **`Logical Operators`** - Using `and` to combine **conditions**
- **`Variables`** - Storing *calculated results* for **comparison**
- **`Print Function`** - Displaying *formatted output* to **console**

### **üìä Weight Tier Breakdown**

**Ground Shipping Tiers:**
- **0-2 lbs:** $1.50/lb + $20 flat
- **2-6 lbs:** $3.00/lb + $20 flat  
- **6-10 lbs:** $4.00/lb + $20 flat
- **10+ lbs:** $4.75/lb + $20 flat

**Drone Shipping Tiers:**
- **0-2 lbs:** $4.50/lb only
- **2-6 lbs:** $9.00/lb only
- **6-10 lbs:** $12.00/lb only
- **10+ lbs:** $14.25/lb only

### **üöö Expected Output Example**

For a **41.5 lb package:**
```terminal
Ground Shipping $ 217.25
Ground Shipping Premium $ 125
Drone Shipping $ 591.375
Premium Ground Shipping is cheapest at $125
```

### **üîÑ Program Flow**

1. **Weight Input** ‚Üí Define *package weight*
2. **Ground Calculation** ‚Üí Apply *appropriate tier* and **flat rate**
3. **Premium Assignment** ‚Üí Set *fixed price* of **$125**
4. **Drone Calculation** ‚Üí Apply *tier rate* with **no flat charge**
5. **Cost Comparison** ‚Üí Find *cheapest option* using **logical operators**
6. **Result Display** ‚Üí Show *best choice* and **final cost**

This program demonstrates how **conditional statements** and **logical operators** can solve *real-world decision-making* problems in **business applications**.
