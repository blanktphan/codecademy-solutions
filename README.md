## üìó Introduction

This repository is my personal space for storing and collecting various projects that I've practiced and built while learning through the [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) platform. Its primary goal is to track my development, showcase my skills, and share my unique problem-solving approaches. Please note, this repository does NOT contain all content from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/).

### üéØ Purpose & Goals
This repository is designed to help me:

* Track Progress ‚Äî Monitor my development in problem-solving and technical skills.
* Deepen Understanding ‚Äî Enhance my understanding of Software-focused Programmer [career paths](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/subject/all).
* Interview Preparation ‚Äî Strengthen my skills for technical interviews and continuous learning.
* Knowledge Sharing ‚Äî Contribute to the broader programming community.
